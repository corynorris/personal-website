# Personal Website
## Overview
This project hosts some information about me, as well as some of my personal projects. It was done with `Laravel 5` and uses some helpful javascript libraries such as `smoothState` to help with pre-loading and transitions.

## Contents

`app/http/controllers/` - as with most `Laravel` projects, most of the application logic is found here.  
`resources/views/` - this folder contains the html pages that exist on the site.


## Limitations
This website is only meant as a quick *at-a-glance* view into my projects, and isn't intended to demonstrate best practices of any kind.
